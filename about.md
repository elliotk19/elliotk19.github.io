  Hello everyone, my name is Elliot Myung Hoon Kim, a high school student who aspires a career in the combination of statistics and computer science, specifically in a field called data science. Ever since I was introduced to the field of computer science during my freshman year, I have consistently learned and taught myself various languages such as C, Java, and Python and fell in love with it. Due to my passion in such fields, I've created this blog which uses Python to analyze various statistics in a wide range of subjects. Hope you enjoy!

Thanks for reading!
