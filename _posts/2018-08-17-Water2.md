<h2>Searching for Datasets</h2>
After conducting a brief research regarding the problems Korea has about fresh water and about the tap water system, I was finally able to somewhat set a goal for the project and started constructing the base of the project: finding the proper and applicable dataset that was worthy of analyzing. The process wasn't too complicated as I basically went to google and looked up 'Korean Water Statistics' in Korean and just went through the top pages.

By going to the first website and going through the information, I wasn't really satisfied with the data they provided. This is because I wanted to be able to download certain datasets whether it be in a form of a txt file or an excel sheet, so that I can actually analyze the information in ways they haven't tried. However, as shown by the picture of the website below, it provided mere generalizations and simple diagrams so that users can understand the information easier.

Knowing I wouldn't be able to find the dataset I wanted, I decided to call the service center to ask where I could get the certain dataset I wanted. Kindly, the customer service center led me to another website which I would've never imagined to access and find what I wanted which was the website of the Ministry of Environment. I was able to look into the website with the specific section regarding the waterways and I was able to somewhat get the dataset I wanted.

As the website took me to the page shown above, it presented me to downloadable waterway datasets from 2011 all the way to 2015 which was very nice for me because now I could be able to compare certain variables by its time value and how certain aspects changed/continued over time.
