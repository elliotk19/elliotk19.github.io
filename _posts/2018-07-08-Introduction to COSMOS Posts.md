Hello everyone! Starting from today, I started attending a camp called COSMOS (California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science) at University of California, Irvine. In this camp, I am taking a class, or a cluster, called Reasoning About Luck: Probability, Statistics, and Their Uses in Science.

[COSMOS Course Description](http://www.cosmos.uci.edu/cluster-2-reasoning-about-luck-probability-statistics-and-their-uses-in-science/)

COSMOS is a 4 week camp in which we alternate between lectures (from two different professors at the University) and lab days (usually computer labs) in which we usually get together in our project groups to work on our final project. The basis of these projects are from the skillsets we learn from lectures and lab days as we mainly learn how to use Python to analyze statistics. I am very excited to spend my 4 weeks here as I will not only be able to socialize with people whom have similar interests as me but also working with them on a subject I am aspiring to study in the future! So throughout the camp I will be posting various things such as the progress of our final project or certain mini projects we do to demonstrate the skills we've learned.
