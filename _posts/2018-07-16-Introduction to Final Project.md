So with three weeks left in the program, my professor introduced the final project to me which is a group project regarding the analysis of Microbiome datasets. At first, I had zero domain knowledge in the field of microbiomes because biology isn't really my favorite subject. So I did some basic research to find out what they are and why it is so crucial to get to know about them more.

As this source quotes, "Microbiota [or microbiomes] have been found to be crucial for immunologic, hormonal and metabolic homeostasis of their host."
Just from this line, I realized how important the research in this field was. However, during today's lecture, not only was the information new, but also the way our group had to analyze the dataset was quite new. Our professor introduced the analysis process called Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in which I will go more in depth in another blog, so I think this process will be rigorous, yet very interesting. <br>
The main goal of the project is to use PCA to find various relationships or causations that might be useful for certain bacterium. For example, we may locate how a certain bacterium was commonly located at a certain body part and with this information, scientists can take a closer look into such places. I guess it will be a heck of a 3 weeks!
