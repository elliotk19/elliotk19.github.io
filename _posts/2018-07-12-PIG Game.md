In the first 4 days of camp, we did many things ranging from the introduction to statistics and Python to us being able to code certain concepts we learned during the statistics lectures. The main concept we talked about was <b> Probability </b>. By basically discussing about what it is and simulating various situations and games, we were able to get a better understanding of how it worked and how we can utilize it. One of the ways I found  most interesting was when we played a game called PIG.

As shown above, the rules are quite simple and each player can employ various strategies to increase their probability to win this game. However, in any game like this, one cannot count the number of strategies he/she can employ because it can technically be anything. As our class discussed the various strategies we can employ, we finalized it to two: ending the turn on a certain number of rolls or ending the turn on a certain point value. But the problem with manually figuring out the best strategy was an arduous task because two people alternating rolling a die until they reach a certain point value may take a very long time. So this is where <b> Python </b> comes in,in which can code the different strategies, simulate the game, and conduct multiple trials in a very short period of time. Therefore I will be post more on the different strategies our class discussed and try to conclude what the best strategy is.
