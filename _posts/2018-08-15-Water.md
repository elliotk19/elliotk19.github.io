After finishing my 4 week summer program at University of California, Irvine and getting a deeper insight into the field of data science, I decided to start another mini project regarding statistics related to the fresh water scarcity in Korea. With this project, I want to apply some of the skills I learned at the camp as well as the various methods of analyzing data I've learned myself reading books so that I can generate various conclusions regarding the fresh water scarcity in Korea.
<h2> Why this topic? </h2>
Water is a topic I was interested in ever since I was young because with my mom working with the Humanitarian aid organization World Vision regarding digging wells for people in Africa with no access to fresh water, I had a personal connection with the lack of fresh water. So as I entered high school, I co-founded a club called Blue Heart which promoted the use of tap water as a solution to the lack of fresh drinkable water as I conducted various research, experiments, and campaigns. Knowing what I am capable of doing and motivated to do in the future, I thought that the combination of my interests in data science and water could best be expressed by executing this  project and get a deeper perception into this subject.
<h2> Fresh Water Scarcity in South Korea </h2>
Being the 109th biggest country in the world, but the 27th most populated country, South Korea has a high population density, which is 10 times the global average. Fresh water in South Korea makes up just 3% of the total South Korean territory of just under 100,000 square kilometers, as the demand for fresh water far exceeds the supply of it. Along with the population density, other challenges that the country faces while trying to sustain this very high level of water and sanitation services include:

<b>Ample but uneven rainfall</b>

On average South Koreaâ€™s annual rainfall is 1,274mm (about 25% higher than the world average) but the heavy rainfalls of summer often cause flooding while the country typically experiences extended droughts in the winter. Geographically, the southern coastal and mountain regions get most of the rainfall, whereas the northern part of the country is more arid. This is a challenge Korea has to face since rainfall is uncontrollable and the fact that it's hard to "distribute" rainfall to all parts of South Korea evenly, finding the corresponding solution towards this problem will be a recurring challenge in the future.

<b>Industrialization and Pollution</b>

Ever since Korea's economic boom in the late 20th century, the development of the economy and industrialization left aside the imminent consequences, specifically environmental issues, that came with the boom. Since most industrial processes require the mass use of fresh water, the technological boom that has been continuing to this day will be another challenge that Korea will face.

<b>Geopolitical Tensions with North Korea</b>

The ongoing tensions with North Korea, geopolitically, have dealt with the construction of several dams on the Imjin river, a major waterway that starts in the north and ends to the northwest of Seoul. With no cooperation between the two countries on flood control, sudden releases of water from the dams without warning have caused flooding and loss of life in South Korea. Dams have been one of the main solutions towards the fresh water problems in order to control the flooding and target the challenge of ample but uneven rainfall by storing the rainfall.

<h2>Korean Tap Water Flow</h2>

As mentioned before, the purpose of this project is take a deeper look into the Korean Tap Water system so that I can generate various conclusions and maybe some solutions towards various challenges presented from data. It will also assess to what extent tap water can be a viable alternative as a source of drinkable water. Although I don't know what type of information or variables I will be analyzing regarding tap water, I do need to have prior knowledge regarding the tap water flow in Korea.

The diagram presented above provided by the official Korean tap water organization, Arisu, shows the basic flow of tap water in which it goes through a series of processes to ensure the sanitation and the better quality of tap water.
